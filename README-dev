how to release
==============
1) Make sure you have committed.
2) Make sure there are no dependencies with security vulnerabilities.
3) mvn release:prepare -Possrh-release. This will update the version numbers. Use your github token as the password.
4) mvn release:perform -Possrh-release. This will upload the artifacts to ossrh. Make sure you have set
   your ossrh username and password in ~/.m2/settings.xml:
   <settings>
       <servers>
           <server>
             <id>ossrh</id>
             <username>xxx</username>
             <password>yyy</password>
           </server>
       </servers>
   </settings>
